# NMR

This repository belongs to one of the lab experiments I did during
my Masters in Physics. 
The idea of the experiment is to teach the students the basics of 
nuclear magnetic resonance. 
Since I thought that the topic was interesting to program, I created this repo. 

In the Jupyter notebooks, some parts of the experiment are redone using the 
simulation.

In `basics.ipynb`, I briefly describe the differences between the simulation
and a real measurement. I also briefly outline the basics of NMR.

Have fun :)
